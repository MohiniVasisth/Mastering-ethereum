Various scenarios can be described where the slow responsiveness of the existing off-chain governance paradigm may pose problems. For example, fast-acting, malicious smart contracts may become the subject of ethical concerns and face calls for the community to alter or even terminate them (“blockchain censorship”). In the case of “the DAO hack of 2016” [referenced later] the community was driven to undertake a contentious hard-fork due to what was widely perceived as a malicious smart contract. Other such contracts could cause serious damage, to society and to the blockchain itself, before existing governance processes were able to act. On-chain governance systems could pre-empt such situations by increasing responsiveness to fast-acting on-chain problems whilst also avoiding the extremes of contentious forks.

As the ecosystem develops actors with a range of motivations will emerge. It is prudent to model how such actors may affect the game-theoretical basis of governance and suggest or prepare to create solutions to the dynamics that they introduce. This approach has its empirical limitations since it is hard to predict unseen behaviours, yet it may become critical to deal with issues that rapidly emerge with time.
